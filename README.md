**Cookie Clicker**
This is a custom cooke clicker replica I created that might not be as long and interesting as the original game... but has some cool additional features such as tools (inspired from childhood roblox simulators) which serve as click multiplers that greatly assist in allowing you to gain more clicks and finish the game. In case you're unfamiliar with cookie clicker, the goal of the game is to simply gain as many cookies as possible with each click earning you some cookies. You can update how many cookies you get per click as well as purchase an autoclicker that clicks every second for you. Try your best to achieve the nuke tool, effectively meaning you completed the game.
